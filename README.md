## Overview

**Project Title**: Inventory Management System

**Project Description**: A simple Inventory Management system that sores items and can check stock levels and display inventory

**Project Goals**: Learn how C++ works and Program a simple inventory system

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install development environment
2. Double click on the inventory.exe file
3. Use the program

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the Program
2. In the main menu select a number 1-6 depending on what you want to do
3. 1 will let you add an item to the inventory. You will need to provide an item name as well as the price and quantity of the item in stock

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add a way to save and load up different Inventories
* [ ] There is still a bug where if you type a non number for the price or quantity it glitches
* [ ] Add more sections so inventories can hold an inventory/category of items
